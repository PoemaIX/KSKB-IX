# Poema IX POP List

## Topology

Poema IX is composed of multiple Points of Presence (PoP), each operating independently.
The PoPs are interconnected using EVPN+VXLAN.

        ???+ PoP Specific Regulations
            KSKB provides resources for free to provide a place for individuals interested in network operation to practice with network configurations. It also allows networking enthusiasts to connect, discuss, and experiment with different network architectures, collectively improving their technical skills. However, for KSKB, electricity costs (â‰ˆNT200/month), internet fees (NT1099/month), and hardware costs (â‰ˆNT25000) are expenses. KSKB does not want its funds to be used for purposes other than experimentation and practicing network configurations. Therefore, the use of VMs is subject to the following regulations:

            <h4>Usage Regulations</h4>
            
            * VMs are only allowed for intranet tunneling and network configuration purposes (such as OSPF/eBGP/iBGP/Route Reflector).
            * The network provided by VMs is only for member-to-member or intranet traffic exchange and should not be used as an external network.
                * The connected entities must meet the following criteria:
                    1. Other nodes within your internal network
                    2. Peering partners
                    3. apt update/git clone traffic required for node maintenance
                * Long-time bandwidth occupation that affects others' usage is prohibited.
            * Prohibited use for other purposes such as proxy hosting, etc., including but not limited to:
                * Provision of public services or public connections is prohibited.
                    * Looking glass or network configuration-related services are allowed.
                * File hosting, such as image hosting/file/web servers, is prohibited.
                * VPN egress is prohibited.
            * If you are a friend of KSKB, you may bypass the above restrictions with KSKB's consent.
        ???+ "VM Access Requirements"
            * You must prove to KSKB that you get the following knowledges:
                1. Understanding of packet forwarding processes in switches.
                2. Knowledge of router routing selection processes.
                3. Understanding of the purpose of dynamic routing and the differences between dynamic and static routing.
                4. Familiarity with the operation of eBGP/iBGP/IGP/RR and the problems these technologies aim to solve.
                5. Must have your own intranet (tunnel-based is acceptable) and include the provided VM in your network.
                6. Your intranet must have IGP and iBGP routing protocols running in it and be able to differentiate between peer and transit tables.
                7. The network interface attached on the IX VM is only used for constructing an internal network tunnel and not for any other services.
                8. Approach learning with a humble attitude and be nice.
            * Proof: Recommendation from group members/exams/interviews/self-provided materials.
           * If you are a friend of KSKB, you may bypass the above restrictions with KSKB's consent.
